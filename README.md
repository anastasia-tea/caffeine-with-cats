I created this website as a fun practice project because I love cats and cafes! I have been a part-time barista throughout my time in university, and I have
made so many happy memories surrounded by the kind people that I have met.
Cafes are still a great passion of mine, and I have turned from a dog person to a cat person (but also still a dog person!) since living with cats for
the first time recently.
I am hoping to visit a cat cafe for the first time soon (unless I open one first), and this felt like a very meaningful way to practice web dev
as I'm getting back into it.
